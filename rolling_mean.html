	<h1>Yearly Rolling Mean</h1>
	    <p style="font-size:18px">
		The first thing we will look at is how the sales (measured both in dollars and volume sold) change as a function of time from 2012 until the last avaliable data.
		Since we are interested in long term trends we will look at a rolling mean, for now we choose a 90 day rolling mean.
		First we plot the rolling mean from 2012 to the most recent data, September 30th, 2020.

			<table>
			 <tr>
			  <td>
				<img src="/static/sale_90day_total.png"/>
			  </td>
			  <td>
				<img src="/static/vol_90day_total.png"/>
			  </td>
			 </tr>
			</table>
			<!-- <figcaption>Caption describing these two images.</figcaption> -->
		</figure>
		<p style="font-size:18px">
		We can see that the amount sold changes as a function of time but tends to increase overall as we get to later years,
		more obviously for the sales in dollars as opposed to the volume sold.
		This hints at the fact that the overall sales grow each year, which is expected since markets tend to grow overtime.
		To more clearly see this we now plot the same data but with respect to day of the year, each year having it's own line.

			 </tr>

		<p style="font-size:18px">
		These plots seem a bit messy but the trends of interest are clear.
		While, in general, the sales each day increase each year we see a large increase for the current year.
		This seems to indicate that, overall, this year is special and has seen and abnormal amount of growth in sales.
		To see this clearly we will need to look at other aspects of the data.
