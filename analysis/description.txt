Abstract:
Covid-19 has had a drastic effect on the world's economy.
It is important to understand exactly how in order to better prepare for future pandemics.
One would idealy like to examine the entire economy, but this is impractical.
Instead I will be focusing on liquor sales in Iowa as a microcosm of the economy.
To do this I will be examine day-by-day sales in Iowa using the databases provided at Iowa Data (data.iowa.gov).
In particular I use the "Iowa Liquor Sales" and the "Iowa Liquor Products" databases.
I examined 3 ascpects: year by year sales in terms of trends, yearly precentage growth, and overall price related buying patterns.
In conclusion I saw that Covid-19 did increase overall sales more than usual yearly growth.
However, sales in dollars increased more than sales in liters.
This was due to the fact that there is an overall trend where more expensive beverages are being bought more.


Here are the background codes that did the data analysis.

There are 2 different files invovled with downloading and simplifying the data:

1) import_files_online.py
  This file downloads the 'date', 'itemno', 'sale_dollars', and 'sale_liters' from the database.
  Authentication has been intentionally left blank.

2) import_items_online.py
  This file downloads the 'itemno', 'im_desc', 'proof', 'state_bottle_retail', and 'bottle_volume_ml' from the database.
  Authentication has been intentionally left blank.

There are 4 different files invovled directly with the data analysis:

1) preprocessing.py
  This file uses the downloaded data to create new datafiles that are used in the analysis.

2) ewm_mean.py
  This file computes the ewm mean and outputs the interactive altair plots.

3) yearly_growth.py
  This file calculates the yearly growth and outputs the graphs used on the yearly growth page.

4) prices.py
  This file does the price data analysis. The output are the altair interactive graphs.
