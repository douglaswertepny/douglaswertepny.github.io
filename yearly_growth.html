	<h1>Total Yearly Growth</h1>
		<p style="font-size:18px">
		To quantify the increase seen previously we now directly examine the amount the sales grew each year.
		Normally when one considers the growth of a market one considers the precent the total sales grew each year.
		Since we are still in the middle of 2020 we instead will look at the cummulative sales as a function of day of the year.

		<p style="font-size:18px">
		At this point we can clearly see how the total amount of sales increases each year.
		How do we quantify this growth?
		The easiest way to do this is assume a consistent precentage growth each year and see how well this model works.
		We choose day 270 (Septempber 26th, 27th for leap years) since it is close to the last avaliable data point for the current year
		and try to fit the years 2012-2019 to constant present growth and see how 2020 compares.

		<p style="font-size:18px">
		Above is a log plot of the data for day 270.
		The line fits years 2012-2019 and indicates a growth rate of 5.1% each year for sales in dollars and 3.2% for volume sold.
		Furthermore the fit works much better for the sales in dollars as opposed to volume sold.
		This however fails to predict the result for 2020, which is a 13.0% increase for sales in and dollars and 8.0% for volume sold from 2019.
		If we use the above fit to project the results for various years we can clearly see how it matches the data.

		<p style="font-size:18px">
		As expected,the projection fails miserably for the year 2020 and works quite will for the other years.
		In the above graph we show 2017 as an example.
		Overall the exponential growth model works much better for sales in dollars as opposed to sales in volume.
		Furthermore the sales in dollars grew more than volume sold.
		In order to understand why this is the case we need to look more carefully at the individual sales.
